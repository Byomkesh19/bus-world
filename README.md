//Problem Statement
As the world grows on, the need to do local travel also increases and one such important means is Bus journey from small to mid level of traveling
In order to simplify this we create an application which can be used by BusOwners and the passengers , where the busOwner will be able to put the status of the bus as running with updated location.
The user can view the available bused for multiple destinations in his/her area.

//Project Structure
The prototype code here is used to simulate starting from login of the user to searching of the buses available
The user does customer login and registration and busowner does for its type
busOwner adds all the buses as per his need and can update whether it is runnign or stopped
the bus location will keep on getting refreshed
the customer can update his/her location and view the buses around him as the bus location is updated by the owner(or drivers may be)
As a scalable code we can later busowner also enable whether a customer is waiting for the bus if the customer is logged in and searched for the bus.
